  Tree And Shrub Services </h2>
<p class="style1">Fertalization Program </p>
<p>	Our fertilization program is used to maintain trees and shrubs in a vigorous condition and to increase their resistance to injury from diseases and insects. However, the addition of any soil nutrient is recommended only if soil or plant foliage tests indicate a deficiency. Trees and shrubs that need fertilization to stimulate more robust and vigorous growth include those exhibiting pale green, undersized leaves and reduced growth rates and those in declining condition (e.g. dead branch tips, dieback) resulting from insect attacks or disease problems. Trees and shrubs which should not be fertilized include newly planted specimens and those with severe root damage from recent trenching or construction. The root systems of these plants will need to re-establish before fertilizers are applied. </p>
<p class="style1">About  Our Fertalizing Program</p>
<p>The best time to fertilize is late April or early May, or late fall once plants are dormant. Our fertalizer is spread evenly across the soil surface using only the best equipment. The amount of actual nitrogen applied should be 3 pounds (lbs) per 1,000 square feet. We do not use fertilizer containing herbicides, Herbicides, also commonly known as weedkillers, are pesticides used to kill unwanted plants such as those formulated for use on lawns. Fertilizer application rates are  based upon the area occupied by the roots. Roots spread well beyond the branches on established trees and shrubs; therefore, the area beneath the plant to be fertilized should be 1- 1/2 times the diameter of the branch spread. For groups of plants, estimate the surface area underneath the entire planting to be fertilized. The example below demonstrates how we determine the area to be fertilized, the amount of nitrogen needed, and the corresponding amount of fertilizer to use.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Mature Tree Pruning and Trimming </strong></p>
<p align="left">On mature trees, pruning is required to remove dead and dying branches   to maintain plant health and safety. This pruning type is referred to as   cleaning. We recomend that you include this into your fertalizing program.   The removal of live   branches is done to reduce density, significantly reduces wind resistance and   subsequent storm damage. Thinning should only be done on trees where the   crown is &quot;too dense&quot; and a J.N.S. Landscaping expert has training and   experience to evaluate this attribute.  Thinning should be concentrated   on the outer portions of the canopy, leaving as many branches on the   interior crown as possible. In some instances, the crown or individual   branches require reduction in length to improve the form and shape of   the plant, to eliminate interference with objects and structures, and to   compensate for structural weaknesses.  Lower branches may require   pruning for similar reasons.  This process, known as raising, also can   be used to increase the amount of light for turf grass and ground covers   beneath the crown of a tree. We are trained to   evaluate the condition of your trees and determine the type(s) of   pruning required to balance your goals and those of managing plant   health and safety.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Young Tree Pruning</strong></p>
<p align="left">One aspect of pruning that is most frequently overlooked by our customers is   structural pruning of young trees.  Trees evolved in forests where they   tend to grow straight and lose lower branches due to competition for   light.  When planted in full sun in the landscape, many species tend to   develop multiple stems/leaders that are more prone to failure.  Lower   branches tend to grow at the same rate as the terminal leader that   results in weak attachments that also are likely to fail later in the   life of the plant.  So pruning trees when they are young and growing   quickly is critical to ensuring a strong framework for future growth.    This pruning focuses on maintaining a single dominant stem unless   multiple stem &quot;clumps&quot; are specifically desired. Branches are pruned so   their size remains proportional to the stem diameter at their point of   attachment.  As trees grow, some branches are removed to ensure adequate   spacing between permanent scaffold limbs. The shape of the tree is   maintained to provide a natural open grown form typical of the species. </p>

<p align="left"><strong>Specialty Shrub Pruning</strong></p>
<p align="left">We can also develop and maintain formal pruning styles   including pollarding, espalier, pleaching, and topiary.  Fruit tree   pruning is becoming increasingly popular as more consumers grow apples,   pears, citrus, and other fruit bearing plants in their gardens.  Vista   pruning, which is judicious removal of branches to enhance a specific   view from a defined location, is also frequently performed especially   for customers with homes with unlevel terrain or near the shoreline.We can also maintain gardens and other specialty plants if necessary.
