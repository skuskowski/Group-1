  Fertalizing Services </h2>
<p>No two lawns are alike. Where you live, whether you have sun or shade, and lots of other  things make a big difference in what your lawn needs. We can help you build a successful  program specifically for your lawn by asking about our annual lawn care program. </p>
<p><img src="Assests/Fert &amp; Tree/rotary_spreader200x200.JPG" width="160" height="160" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most important thing you can do for your lawn is to feed it. A well-fed lawn is  healthier, which means it has a better root system to combat heat, cold, drought, mowing, foot  traffic and other stresses. While feeding your lawn once a year will improve its condition,  feeding it four times a year will make it even healthier. If you put your lawn on our  regular  fertalizing schedule outlined below, it will look lush and green, and your neighbors will turn  green with envy.</p>
<p><strong>Early Spring (February - April)</strong></p>
<p>Lawns need fertalizer in the spring. Feeding your lawn in the   spring strengthens roots and  gets it off to a good start before the heavy growing season. If you had   crabgrass last year, we will apply a combination fertilizer with a pre-emergent   to control it.</p>
<p><strong>Late Spring (April - June)</strong></p>
<p>Spring is a mid year fertalizing point.  Your grass is busy and using up stored energy. That's why  we want to supply the lawn with a feeding designed for this time of year. Unfortunately,  broadleaf weeds are actively growing, too. we will control them and feed your lawn with a combination of  fertilizer with broadleaf weed control (a &quot;weed-n-feed&quot;).</p>
<p><strong>Summer (June - August)</strong></p>
<p>Summer is tough on grass. Heat, drought, foot traffic, and insects stress it out. we will feed your lawn in the summer protecting and strengthening it against these problems. Lawns in  warm-season grass areas should be fed over the summer months as they grow steadily from spring  to fall. If you see insects in your grass, Let us know immediatly and we will apply a feeding product that also contains insect  control.</p>
<p><strong>Fall (September - November) </strong></p>
<p>Fall brings back ideal conditions for your lawn. Cool nights, ample rainfall and morning dew  are just about as good as it gets for grass. Now the lawn is ready to grow again, and is  looking for the nutrients it needs to recover from summer damage. We at J.N.S landscsaping say this is  the single most important lawn feeding of the year. we will apply your final feeding right before the  winter months, when grass is prepping for a winter nap. This will strengthen roots and increase  nitrogen storage for an early spring green up and a healthier lawn next year. Following a  general program like this one should improve your lawn. For a more specific plan for your lawn,  build your very own program at our regular  fertalizing schedule.
